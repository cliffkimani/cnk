# Back-end

We will definitely need python django for this. In future we may need to roll out a smooth transition to a more memory-friendly language like C++ of Golang but for now, what we need is speed. We need the site to be up and running as fast as possible, in order to attract a following. Any re-engineering in the future will be solely funded from the profits and on demand.

# Front-End

 We will definitely need some JavaScript to have one page applications working, Asynchronous tasks as well as smart graphics. We need a Javascript Guru for this task. Any library will do; Angular, Node or Jquery.

At the same time we will need a CSS web designer for the theme of various ages within the site. At minimum, we need themes for all the pages, all printouts, free-flow responsive mobile views, projector views as well as CSS for auto generated pdf reports for various parameters. CSS frameworks are welcome. The Designer(s) should be familiar with The Django Template System or any other plausible Template engine that python can understand.

# SEO

We shall definitely need to generate organic traffic to reduce the advertising an startup cost. Thus we need an SEO expert to optimize the most searched terms for this on the Kenyan market. Some of the terms that can be optimized include: Bets church cloud application, Online Fellowship of Christian professionals,  Best church management app, etc. etc. The point is that we need to minimizize the startup cost that will get this site up and running on the go. That is a small price to pay for a good chink of the Kenyan market share.

# Non-technical content writers

Like any other website, the CNK will be all about news, data and information. As such, we need contributors to have the site rolling. We shall need at least 50 posts that will rank highly in the niche keywords effortlessly. This way, the phenomenon will grow from glory to glory.

# Mobile Compatibility

70% of web access is via a mobile device. This means that the system has to be seamlessly accessible through a mobile device. Primarily, we shall make the site responsive (refer to the Designers ssection). At the same time, we shall have strategic mobile intergration hooks in the backend in order to allow further mobile programming in the future. This will be by use of restful APIs and Json Webhooks that will be instrumental for mobile developers who will make IOs, Windows and Android apps for us in the future. This way, the sytem will be accessible to pastors, visitors, members, advertisers, businesses, and all other stakeholders through special hooks to the database.

# Timeline

- Backend – 120 man hours (About 12 days for one coder)
  - This is the basic logic and skeleton of the site.

# Conclusion

We should be looking at a stack that looks like th following:

- Backend
  - Engine - Python/Django
  - DB – PostgreSQL
  - DB NoSQL
  - Data Scraping - Scrapy
  - Data Analytics – Pandas
  - Server – Apache
  - Server Hook - Gunicorn
-  Version Control
  - GitLab/GitHub
- Front-End
  - Styling CSS
  - Magic Javascript
  - Template – Django Templates
-  Administration
  - SEO
  - Writers
  -  Data Entry

The best way to market this software is by doing some SEO homework as well as engaging at church level. To attract churches we can introduce some awesome features such as:

- Free posters design engine
- Church even management engine
- Church staff management module
- Church communication module (SMS and Email)
- Church growth prospects module
- Church financial management module
- Pastors son-ship and mentorship module

This way, pastors will come in droves and request their flock to sign up under them. That&#39;s Multi-Level Marketing. We shall also have a blog that aggregates all pastors&#39; doctrinal posts above 200 words into public blogs.

To get the flock, we should make it easy for them to authenticate from anywhere and from existing platforms without registering. This may include:

- Gmail sign-ups
- Facebook Sign-ups
- Twitter Sign Ups
- Linked In Sign Ups

At the end of the day, We expect majority of the mega-churches to comply. Which will spread organically to all smaller churches.

The project can be potentially multi-million but requires patience and hard work. Prospective tidy income could delay to until the 6# th month depending with the intensity of the marketing.
